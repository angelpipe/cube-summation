# Cube summation

Solution to the hackerrank problem listed here https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cube-summation

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6.4

## How to run

```php artisan serve```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000

IMPORTANT: The app will process any quantity of test cases, so the first 
input line with an integer is not necessary and will be marked as an error. 
Also, the app would be able to process any quantity of queries without 
specifying it; but this behavior was kept for integrity.

*Due the simplicity of the project, Laravel's default development server 
was used instead of homestead or docker as they would increase development
and set up*
